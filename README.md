# homework
- 第一次的使用github

- note: 附件一为第一道题目，附件二为第二道题目.

## 两道算法题：
### 第一题：
- Your task is to calculate the sum of some integers.

### 第二题：
- "Well, it seems the first problem is too easy. I will let you know how foolish you are later." feng5166 says.

- "The second problem is, given an positive integer N, we define an equation like this:
-   N=a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+...+a[m];
-   a[i]>0,1<=m<=N;
- My question is how many different equations you can find for a given N.
- For example, assume N is 4, we can find:
-   4 = 4;
-   4 = 3 + 1;
-   4 = 2 + 2;
-   4 = 2 + 1 + 1;
-   4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1;
- so the result is 5 when N is 4. Note that "4 = 3 + 1" and "4 = 1 + 3" is the same in this problem. Now, you do it!"
